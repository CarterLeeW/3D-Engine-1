<p>This project is my ongoing portfolio piece where I create an OpenGL sandbox made from loosely coupled, reusable components.</p>
<p>Currently, the engine is in its infancy and I am constantly adding components and making changes, but the main branch should always be runnable.</p>
<p>This repo has all of the code and third party dependencies required to run the project, just clone the repo and change the macro definition for RESOURCE_PATH in "scene.h" to your local project directory.</p>
